# EchoStateNetwork

## Description

EchoStateNetwork is an implementation of an Echo State Network (ESN) by Defne. It includes a validation method for automatic hyperparameter tuning and a demonstration on the Lorenz-63 dataset.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide a reference implementation of an Echo State Network for the MagriLab. It serves as a starting point for understanding and working with ESNs in the context of chaotic dynamical systems.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the prerequisites installed, which you can find in the `requirements.txt` file.
